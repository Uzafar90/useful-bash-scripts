# Useful Bash Scripts Collection

Welcome to my collection of useful Bash scripts! This repository is a collection of various Bash scripts that I am currently learning and implementing in my homelab environment. Each script is designed to automate and simplify different tasks, ranging from system maintenance to network management. As I continue to expand my knowledge and skills in Bash scripting, I will be adding more scripts to this collection. Feel free to explore, use, and modify these scripts to suit your own needs.
